## Hi, I'm David Gaspard

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/david_water.jpg" width="50%">

I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft and more importantly a technologist at heart. I'm originally from [Jacksonville Florida](https://www.google.com/search?q=jacksonville+florida&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS914US914&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ALeKk00waXA58G46EdNq3cuXhIAR8MOfcQ:1618165284607&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwic0ue35_bvAhVmIDQIHeW_DwsQ_AUIESgD&biw=2400&bih=1110&dpr=0.8) and went to [Georgia Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech) for my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Engineering. Something about the [Multi-cycle datapath](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~childers/CS0447/lectures/lect-multicycle.pdf) and [branch prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor) really sparked my interest and I decided to specialize in Computer Architecture but my career has taken me all over the place.

After ['getting out'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditions_of_the_Georgia_Institute_of_Technology#Getting_Out), I started my career in Atlanta as a software consultant at Regulated Capital consultants, which was in it's naissance at the time, learning the art of getting it done. It was a sink or swim environment where I acquired my customer obsession and indefatigability. I later decided to rekindle my passion for engineering and moved to Intel to work as a synthesis engineer on the Quartus Compiler for their [FPGA](https://www.sparkfun.com/fpga) lines, which was the coolest and most acedmically challenging role that I've found myself in to date. Inadaptability and slowly decreasing market share coupled with [Satya Nadella's](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/after-5-years-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-has-transformed-more-than-the-stock-price/) early success as CEO of Microsoft encouraged me to make the leap over to Azure and when the opportunity with the O365-Azure team arose, I was quick to try my hand and I've been at Microsft ever since. More about my career history can be found at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gaspard-43490bba/)

I love to travel and have visitied many countries in Western Europe and I'm looking to make more global tracks soon. **Sydeny, Tokyo, and Bali** are high on my list. But I'm really looking forward to take more advantage of my own back yard and getting to know the USA as well.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading about all of the latest trends in technology all across the stack, playing basketball, working out and traveling
